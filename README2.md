Generally, you will put your README on your frontend repo if you have separate backend and frontend. To organize your README, you can link to a documentation page that contains all the individual links, or link sections from the README. You can also use GitHub's Wiki feature if you would like. Your README should have an index with the following links:

Feature list document
React Components list (if you used React)
Database Schema (if you used a database)
frontend routes document
API routes document (if you have a backend API)
Redux store tree document (if you used Redux)
Your project README also needs to include all the following pieces of information:

Name of the project
Link to live site
Link to your backend repo if you have a separate one
Summary of what the project is and what it does
Screenshots of your app in action (once completed)
Instructions on how to build/run the project (installation instructions)
List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
To-dos/future features
Technical implementation details
Anything you had to stop and think about before building
Descriptions of particular challenges
Snippets or links to see code for these
Best Practices
Divide your README into distinct sections
List the technologies used at the top of your README for increased visibility

Include link to the live site
Provide instructions for how to install project (if applicable)
